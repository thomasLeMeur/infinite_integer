This library provides a C structure to manipulates infinite numbers in many bases (comparaisons, operations, print)

Code coverage (96.61%) :
make re
./prog
gcov *.c

To do :
- infint_to_string		(utilities.c)
- infint_new_from_string	(allocations.c)
- div mod (operations.c)
- update unit_tests.c
- rule for test program, else make the library
- update README for limit (theorical, practical in memory, limits (memory and complexity for operations) -> see .h)
- say the tests are done for 64bits
